        <p>The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre at Sydney Harbour located in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.

Designed by Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed up by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.

The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

The building comprises multiple performance venues, which together host well over 1,500 performances annually, attended by more than 1.2 million people. Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, including three resident companies: Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, the site is visited by more than eight million people annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year. The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.</p>

         <p>Brisbane City is the central suburb and central business district of the City of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. It is colloquially referred to as the "Brisbane CBD" or "the city". It is located on a point on the northern bank of the Brisbane River, historically known as Meanjin, Mianjin or Meeanjin in the local Aboriginal Australian dialect. The triangular shaped area is bounded by the median of the Brisbane River to the east, south and west. The point, known at its tip as Gardens Point, slopes upward to the north-west where the city is bounded by parkland and the inner city suburb of Spring Hill to the north. The CBD is bounded to the north-east by the suburb of Fortitude Valley. To the west the CBD is bounded by Petrie Terrace, which in 2010 was reinstated as a suburb (after being made a locality of Brisbane City in the 1970s).</p>

        <p> Up to 300,000 different species of animals live in Australia, of which only 100,000 have been classified and counted. It is a typical fauna, present in Australia since the time when the continent was part of Gondwana, with many characteristics common to the fauna of New Guinea and that of South Africa. The only oviparous mammals in the world derive from Gondwana: the platypus, which lives in the rivers of south-eastern Australia, and the echidna which is also present in New Guinea. Although they also live in South America, marsupial mammals are characteristic of Australia, of which the best known is the kangaroo, of which there are about 50 species, widespread in the temperate and tropical zones. Also typical of Australia are smaller marsupials, among these are the opossum and the koala; eating only eucalyptus leaves, the latter was seriously threatened by the destruction of the woods and is a protected species throughout Australia. The only placental mammals living in Australia - rodents, bats and the dingo (wild dog) - are of Asian origin; it is believed that the aborigines may have brought the dingo, a nocturnal predator that feeds mainly on sheep, to the region. Among the reptiles present on the continent there are two species of crocodiles, including the marine crocodile, the largest on the planet. Among the various species of lizards are the moloch and the blue-tongued tiliqua. In Australia there are about 100 species of venomous snakes, such as the inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus), considered the most powerful venom snake in the world, and the death viper. Australia's seas are home to a large variety of fish and aquatic mammals. Numerous species of whales are found in the southern waters, while the seal inhabits the southern coast, islands in the Bass Strait and Tasmania. About 70 species of sharks live in Australian waters, many of which are dangerous to humans. Typical and endemic species also live in fresh waters, such as the murray cod and the Australian eel. There are also various alien and intrusive fish species such as rainbow trout.

   <p>The flora of Australia is rich and diverse and the vegetation is predominantly made up of evergreen plants. The Australian flora is distributed in three main zones: the tropical zone, along the northern edges of the continent and in part of the eastern coasts; the temperate zone along the southeastern coast, including Tasmania; and the inland area, characterized by a monsoonal climate and high temperature, is covered by dense forests mostly of non-perennial trees. Along the north-eastern coast, rainforests are widespread, palms, ferns and climbing plants thrive along with oaks, ash trees, cedars, beeches and undergrowth vegetation, while mangroves (with their typical aerial roots) develop along the humid northern coastal strip. Inside is the savannah. The temperate zone is mainly characterized by plants that adapt to a constantly arid climate and soil (or also called xerophytes), by the savannah of eucalyptus forests, by temperate rainforests and by alpine vegetation in the Australian Alps and in the reliefs of Tasmania. Pine, a tree not native to Australia, grows along the eastern coasts and in Tasmania. Tasmania is characterized by beech forests and vegetation very similar to that of New Zealand. In inland regions, savannah, steppe and semi-arid grasslands predominate.
